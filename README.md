# chiller-configs
A repo holding all my personal configurations I use.

Feel free to copy my configs but this repo is designed for me and private use.
So don't expect anything from it.

## bashrc

.bashrc has its own repository at: https://github.com/ChillerDragon/bashrc.d

But it is designed to be automatically installed when installing crools:


https://github.com/ChillerDragon/crools


## setup

to automatically update all configs execute:
``./setup.sh``


## gnome settings

I use default mouse speed:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 0.0
```
