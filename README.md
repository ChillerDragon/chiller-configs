# chiller-configs
A repo holding all my personal configurations I use.

Feel free to copy my configs but this repo is designed for me and private use.
So don't expect anything from it.

# setup

to automatically update all configs execute:
``./setup.sh``

# debian /etc/apt/sources.list

```
# debian 10
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main contrib non-free

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ buster/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ buster/updates main contrib non-free
```

# gnome settings

I use default mouse speed:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 0.0
```
