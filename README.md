# chiller-configs
A repo holding all my personal configurations I use.

Feel free to copy my configs but this repo is designed for me an private use.
So don't expect anything from it.

# setup

to automatically update all configs execute:
``./setup.sh``

# debian /etc/apt/sources.list

```
# debian 10
